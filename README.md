Module 3 Homework Assignment - Python Challenge

## PyBank Challenge
In this challenge we were tasked with creating a python script to analyze financial records of a company. We were provided a dataset called budget_data which was composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses"

The python script should analyze the data to calculate each of the following values:
* Total number of months included in the dataset
* Net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period
* Average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount)
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount)

In addition to the final script, the code should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the final results.

## PyPoll Challenge
In this challenge we were tasked with helping a small town modernize it's vote counting process. We were provided a dataset called election_data which was composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 

Our task was to create a python script that would analyze the votes and calculate each of the following values:
* Total number of votes
* A complete list of candidates
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote

In addition to the final script, the code should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the final results.
